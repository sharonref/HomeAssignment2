          I really donâ€™t know what else I can tell about my self...
          <br />
          So I will paste here a summery of the movie Mulan (which is my
          Favorite Disney movie):

          <br />
          "Mulan," the classic Disney animated film released in 1998, is an epic
          tale that unfolds against the backdrop of ancient China. The story
          revolves around Fa Mulan, a spirited and determined young woman who
          challenges societal norms and traditional gender roles in order to
          protect her family and her country. <br />
          The narrative begins with the Emperor's decree that one man from each
          family must join the army to defend China against an imminent invasion
          led by the ruthless Shan Yu. Mulan's elderly father, Fa Zhou, is
          unable to withstand the rigors of military service, and sensing the
          impending danger, Mulan makes a courageous decision. Disguising
          herself as a man, she takes her father's place, embarking on a journey
          that will test her physical prowess, resilience, and the very fabric
          of societal expectations. <br />
          Under the alias "Ping," Mulan endures the challenges of military
          training alongside her fellow soldiers. Throughout this arduous
          process, she forms deep bonds with her comrades, including the
          boisterous Mushu, a small dragon who becomes her guardian, and
          Cri-Kee, a cricket believed to bring good luck. <br />
          As the story unfolds, Mulan's true identity is eventually revealed,
          leading to a confrontation with the consequences of her actions.
          Despite breaking tradition, she finds herself at the forefront of a
          battle against the formidable Shan Yu, whose invasion threatens the
          safety of China. Mulan's resourcefulness, intelligence, and martial
          skills prove instrumental in not only thwarting Shan Yu's plans but
          also earning her the respect and admiration of her fellow soldiers.
          <br />
          The film's narrative is interwoven with humor, heart, and
          unforgettable music, including the iconic song "Reflection," which
          captures Mulan's internal struggle with societal expectations and the
          desire to forge her own path. Mulan's journey is a celebration of
          individuality, courage, and the triumph of the human spirit over
          adversity. <br />
          Ultimately, "Mulan" is a timeless Disney classic that continues to
          resonate with audiences of all ages, offering a powerful message about
          breaking barriers, embracing one's true self, and the enduring
          strength that comes from staying true to one's convictions. Mulan's
          legacy is that of a hero who defied convention, making her mark not
          only in the hearts of her fellow characters but also in the annals of
          animated cinematic history.
