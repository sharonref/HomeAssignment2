          <h2>Come Eat With Me</h2>
          <h3>friends addition</h3>
          <p>
            Inspired by the viral sensation of the show "Come Eat with Me," I
            took it upon myself to initiate a similar experience within our
            close-knit group. With a shared love for food and dinner parties, I
            crafted the rules and guidelines to ensure a memorable and enjoyable
            dining adventure for all participants. I wanted this game to make us
            closer after starting to stay away from each other. Drawing from the
            show's premise, I encouraged each member to take turns hosting
            themed dinners at their homes, showcasing their culinary skills.
            <br />From Italian feasts to Asian fusion extravaganzas, each
            gathering became an opportunity to explore diverse cuisines and bond
            over shared meals. Additionally, I established a tradition of making
            up activity that will make us closer and will bond us. <br />Through
            this initiative, we not only indulged in delicious food but also
            cultivated a sense of community and belonging within our group,
            making "Come Eat with Me" more than just a meal, but a cherished
            tradition. That I hope will never happen again. <br />
            When competitiveness becomes excessive, it can breed an atmosphere
            of tension and discord among individuals. Instead of fostering
            healthy competition, an excessive competitive spirit may overshadow
            the value of teamwork and mutual support. It's important to strike a
            balance between healthy competition and cooperation, recognizing
            that true success often lies in collective efforts and shared
            achievements. <br />
            Maybe next time we will just have a lovely dinner party with good
            food, nice alcohol and a civilized and pleasant conversation.

          <h2>FOTD</h2>
          <h3>food of the date</h3>
          <p>
            In a playful jab at the trend of influencers' OOTD, I introduced a
            quirky segment into my close friends story called "FOTD" - Food of
            the Day. This corner evolved into a delightful showcase of my
            culinary adventures. With each story, I captured moments of
            excitement and discovery as I brought unique snacks to school and
            filling lunches.
            <br />
            As time went on, "FOTD" grew beyond mere presentation to include the
            essence of homemade goodness, as I started sharing recipes for the
            delectable treats featured. This fusion of humor, culinary
            creativity, and generosity became a cherished addition to our shared
            experiences, blending laughter with the joys of discovering and
            delicious homemade fare. <br />
            As the days passed, the popularity of "FOTD" grow popularity with
            friends eagerly anticipating the next culinary creation. It wasn't
            long before the segment transcended mere presentation, evolving into
            a celebration of homemade goodness, complete with recipes for the
            mouthwatering treats featured. This delightful fusion of humor,
            culinary ingenuity, and generosity became a cherished fixture in our
            shared experiences, seamlessly blending laughter with the joys of
            savoring and sharing delicious homemade fare. As the segment gained
            momentum, I found myself pleasantly surprised by the influx of
            recipes and culinary inspirations shared by friends, fostering a
            beautiful exchange of culinary creativity and camaraderie.
