Pages
Home: This page serves as the landing page, introducing visitors to my portfolio and providing an overview of what they can expect to find on the website.
About Me: Here, I share information about myself, my background or Mulan's background because I did not want to share about myself.
Resume: On this page, I provide my resume, detailing my education, work experience, skills, and achievements.
Projects: This is the highlight of the website. It features a showcase of the projects I've worked on, allowing visitors to get to know me. Creating the projects section was the most enjoyable part of this assignment. I had a clear vision of what I wanted to include, and it was exciting to see it come to life on the website.

Challenges Faced
While working on this assignment, I encountered several challenges. One of the biggest hurdles was the navigation bar on mobile devices. Initially, I felt unprepared to tackle this aspect, but with the collaboration in class, I overcame it. Thank you for the help!
Another challenge I faced was with the positioning of elements on the page. I struggled with relative and sticky positioning, which took some time to understand and implement correctly. However, I'm proud to say that I found a simple yet effective solution after some contemplation and experimentation.
I also felt that 4 pages was a bit too much. The difficulty was in crafting unique and engaging content for each page - while the CSS was repetitive at some point.

Overall, it was a nice home assignment. It encouraged me to learn more about CSS and come up with solutions independently.
